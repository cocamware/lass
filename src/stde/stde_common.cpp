 *  @note CURRENTLY, THIS FILE IS EXCLUDED FROM BUILD.  This means there's no precompiled header
 *        generated.  But we don't mind, since no one can use it anyway. [BdG]
 *  @note FROM NOW on, this file is AGAIN INCLUDED... otherwise no build whatever is performed
 *        and other libraries start complaining [TDM]
 *  @note WELL, SINCE TODAY, we try to EXCLUDE this from build again.  But this time, we try
 *        to be more clever and disable the automatic link to the static library, so other
 *        libraries stop whining =) [BdG]
