// in prim/impl, precompiled header stuff needs to include prim_common.h instead of ../prim_common.h
// of course, this borks when precompiled header stuff is disabled because util_common.h is
// located elsewhere.  so, that's why we have this file as replacement.

// redirect to parent prim_common.h
#include "../prim_common.h"

// EOF
