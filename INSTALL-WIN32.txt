LASS is an open source C++ library written by Tom De Muer and Bram de Greve to
help the authors writing better code. It includes an interfacing library to 
Python, templated geometric primitives and spatial subdivision schemes, several
design patterns and other utilities the authors use in their day-to-day 
codings. LASS is licensed under the GNU GPL and hosted by SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/) where you can find LASS' project page.

I. DOWNLOAD LASS SOURCE
=======================

Since you're reading this, you've probably already done so.  Here it is anyway:

1. Download from CVS
--------------------

You can get the very latest Lass sourcecode right from CVS using the following parameters:
cvsroot = :pserver:anonymous@lass.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lass 
modulename = Lass

If you don't have a CVS client yet, you can try TortoiseCVS (http://www.tortoisecvs.org).
It's a free CVS client that integrates in Windows Explorer

More information about the Lass CVS repository can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=118315



II. CHECK YOU VISUAL C++ INSTALLATION
=====================================

Lass can be build using Microsoft Visual C++.  Solution files for versions 7.1 (2003) and
8.0 (2005) are included.  If you don't have Microsoft Visual C++, you can install a free
version of it called Visual C++ 2005 Express.

1. Visual C++ 2005 Express
--------------------------

Homepage: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/

If you haven't yet installed Visual C++ 2005 Express, go to 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/ from where you can download
and install it.  At the end of the installation, you will be asked to register your copy,
do so.

Visual C++ 2005 Express is a limited edition and is not capable of building Win32 
applications out of the box (it can build .NET applications though).  Fortunately,
you can solve that by installing the Windows Platform SDK:

- download and install the Windows Platform SDK: 
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=484269E2-3B89-47E3-8EB7-1F2BE6D7123A&displaylang=en

- Add the following VC++ directories in the "Projects and Solutions" section of the Options
  dialog box:

  executable files: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Bin
  include files: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include
  library files: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib

More information about using the Windows Platform SDK with Visual C++ 2005 Express can be
found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/



III. INSTALL PYTHON
===================

If you don't have Python yet, now is the time to install it since you're going to need it.
Go to http://python.org/ and install the latest version.  

We've had successful builds with Python versions starting from 2.2, but we recommend
at least Python 2.3.

Once you've installed Python, you will have to add some VC++ directories to the 
"Projects and Solutions" section of the Options dialog box (here, it is assumed that you've
installed python to C:\Python25):

include files: C:\Python25\include
library files: C:\Python25\libs
executable files: C:\Python25 (in case Visual C++ is unable to find python.exe during pre-build)



IV. BUILD LASS
===============

1. static libraries
-------------------

The static libraries can be build and tested from the solution files src\lass.sln (7.1) and 
src\lass_vc8.sln (8.0).

2. dynamic libraries
--------------------

The static libraries can be build from the solution files src\dll\dll.sln (7.1) and 
src\dll\dll_vc8.sln (8.0).



V. INSTALL LASS
