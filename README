LASS is an open source C++ library written by Tom De Muer and Bram de Greve to
help the authors writing better code. It includes an interfacing library to 
Python, templated geometric primitives and spatial subdivision schemes, several
design patterns and other utilities the authors use in their day-to-day 
codings. LASS is licensed under the GNU GPL and hosted by SourceForge 
(http://sourceforge.net/) where you can find LASS' project page.


BUILDING and INSTALLING
=======================

UNIX
----

If you're on a UNIX style platform, you can can build and install LASS in the 
usual './configure; make install' way.  See INSTALL if you don't know what that
is.

If you've downloaded LASS from the CVS, you'll notice there's no 'configure'
script yet.  You'll have to execute 'autoconfiscate_unix.py' first.  This

LASS also includes a self-test, which can be build and run by invoking
'make check'.

NOTES:

- LASS contains an interface library to the Python language, so you have to 
  have Python installed on your system.  We recommend at least Python 2.3.

- If you need to run 'autoconfiscate_unix.py', you will need to have installed
  'autoconf' (>= 2.59) and 'automake' (>= 1.8).  'autoconfiscate_unix.py' 
  generates 'configure.ac' and different 'Makefile.in' from the information it
  finds from scanning the source directories.  It then calls 'autoconf' and 
  'automake' to generated the needed 'configure' script and 'Makefile' files.
