LASS is an open source C++ library written by Tom De Muer and Bram de Greve 
to help the authors writing better code. It includes an interfacing library 
to Python, templated geometric primitives and spatial subdivision schemes, 
several design patterns and other utilities the authors use in their 
day-to-day codings. LASS is licensed under the GNU GPL and hosted by 
SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/) where you can find LASS' project page.


BUILDING and INSTALLING
=======================

UNIX
----

If you're on a UNIX style platform, you can can build and install LASS
in the usual './configure; make install' way.  See INSTALL if you don't 
know what that is.

LASS also includes a self-test, which can be build and run by invoking
'make check'.

For developers only: if you've added new source files or you've
edited source files that require a prebuild, you should run
autoconfiscate_unix.py to update the necessarey configure and makefiles.
Once you've done that, you can run configure and make.

WIN32
-----

See INSTALL.win32.txt for more information ...
